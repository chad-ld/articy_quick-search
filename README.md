# Articy Draft Quick Search Box
This plugin was designed to help you navigate around the Articy flow quicker and mouse free, without having to navigate all the way over to the side and toggle the search pane to find a specific node in the flow. Instead, I bring the search pane to you!

You can stay hands off the mouse by using the tab key to switch to the list and use the arrow keys to browse. Once you’ve found the node you are looking for, stay hands off by hitting tab one more time and pressing enter. You will then be taken to the node you selected. (Video demo at the top of this page)
